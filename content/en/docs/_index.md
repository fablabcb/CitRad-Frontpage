## Requirements
- Soldering experience**: Soldering the components together is challenging in places. You should therefore have soldering experience or get someone with soldering experience to help you.
- You will need the parts from the [shopping list](/docs/shopping list/) and the necessary tools. You can check [parts and tools list](docs/bauanleitung/teile_und_werkzeug/) to see if you have everything you need. If you decide to design your own housing solution, you are of course welcome to do so. You may save a few laser cut/3D printed parts.
## Time required
Experience from the first building workshops shows that you should take **between 2 and 3 hours**, depending on your soldering skills.

## Dealing with the instructions
- Read through the complete instructions **once** and check whether you can follow all the steps. This will also help you to better understand the individual steps.
- Photos and description texts complement each other. Read through the instructions in full for each step and take a close look at all the photos for each step. Then you shouldn't have any problems.
