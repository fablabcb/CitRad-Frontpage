Why Citrad?

CitRad started as an open hardware and citizen science project at [Fablab Cottbus e.V.](https://fablab-cottbus.de) to give citizens
to give citizens the opportunity to record traffic phenomena independently and in compliance with data protection regulations. At that time, an open hardware radar sensor was created that is as easy as possible to replicate. Now we want to perfect the evaluation algorithm and create a data platform that displays traffic data clearly on maps or as other evaluations and makes it available. We are delighted that this project is one of 25 projects funded by the [Prototypefund](https://prototypefund.de/) in round 16. This means that we will receive financial support over the next six months (Sep 2024 - Feb 2025) to make the CitRad prototype a reality.

## Why are we doing this?
We believe that discussions about traffic and mobility in urban areas are often based on perceived truths. “All the cars are speeding through our residential area too fast” or ‘There aren't that many cyclists riding along here to make an extra cycle path worthwhile’ are typical statements that are based on individual snapshots and quickly turn constructive discussions into battles of faith. With CitRad, we want to base these discussions on facts again and give everyone who is interested the opportunity to contribute objective and continuously collected data sets to these discussions.

## Who is the prototype aimed at?
First of all, with CitRad we want to reach **people** who are in some way dissatisfied with the traffic situation in their city or on their doorstep or who are interested in what is really going on in their area in terms of traffic. This motivation is important if we are to obtain meaningful and sufficient data. 


CitRad is certainly also of interest to all **municipalities** that want to improve traffic conditions for their citizens. The small and inexpensive sensors can be installed more frequently in urban areas than expensive commercial versions. This provides a better view of the big picture. Long-term observations are also better possible with many available sensors. 


Last but not least, the freely accessible data also benefits **research**. Mobility planners should be able to draw their own conclusions from the data sets and feed back their findings.

## What is CitRad not yet?
We have lots of ideas on how to make CitRad even more convenient. Data upload via LoRaWAN, longer runtime with solar, differentiation of road users, WLAN/Bluetooth and much more. But first and foremost we want to take care of a reliable evaluation and a meaningful data platform. Are you interested in working on these comfort functions?
