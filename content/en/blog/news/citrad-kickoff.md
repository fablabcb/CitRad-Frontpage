After the hardware was developed the year before, CitRad is one of the funded projects of the 16th round of the Prototype Fund Software. The funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research enables us to improve the sensor's evaluation routines and work on a data platform. The funding period runs until February 2025.

Following the development of the hardware and the initial tests, we took the opportunity in 2024 to present CitRad at district festivals and events such as the car-free university day and Parking Day. The response was consistently positive. We also presented CitRad to the city of Cottbus in spring 2024. It quickly became clear that there was a basic level of interest from a wide range of parties - from private individuals to mobility research and urban development.

## Successfull application to the Prototype Fund
It quickly became clear that we wanted to continue working on CitRad. The fact that the application phase for the 16th round of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de) had just started played into our hands. So we had to write an application and hope. But not for too long. Soon the invitation to the kick-off event on September 1 in Berlin fluttered into our mailbox.

CitRad is now one of 25 open source projects that will be funded for six months. Six other projects can also be assigned to the topic of city/mobility. We are excited to see where we will find intersections and look forward to an exciting next six months
