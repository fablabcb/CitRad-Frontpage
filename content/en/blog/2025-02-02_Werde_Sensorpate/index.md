On February 15, 2025 at 2 pm the next building workshop for CitRad sensors will take place. We want to build more sensors together with you to collect even more data from locations in and around Cottbus. Those who take part in this construction workshop can take the self-built sensor home with them as a permanent loan and collect traffic data. If the sensor is no longer actively used, you can simply return it to us. For space reasons, we can unfortunately only offer this to *five* people** on this day. It's worth [registering](#registration) quickly.

With a little dexterity, the CitRad sensor can be assembled in a reasonable amount of time.

## Workshop procedure
- Brief introduction to the current status of the project
- Joint/guided construction of the CitRad sensor
- Instructions for setting up the sensor
- Introduction to the data platform.
## Duration
**13-approx. 17:** We start at 13:00. Building the sensors will take 2-3 hours, depending on your individual pace. But because we also want to explain the further use and answer your questions in peace, it is better to take 4 hours.
## Location
We will meet at:<br>
Fablab Cottbus<br>
Walther-Pauer-Stra√üe 7<br>
03046 Cottbus

## Registration
Unfortunately, we only have limited space in the lab. So that everyone can work well and be supervised by us, we limit the number of participants to 5 people.  {{< cloakemail address="info@citrad.de" query="subject=Bauworkshop 15.2." display="Register by February 12th by mail" >}}.

We look forward to your registration / your coming and are available for questions at any time {{< cloakemail address="info@citrad.de" display="per Mail" >}}.
