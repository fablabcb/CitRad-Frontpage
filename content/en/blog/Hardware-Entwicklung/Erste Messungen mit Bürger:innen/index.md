With an initial prototype that provides data, we were finally able to invite interested parties to take measurements. At the same time, we took the opportunity to present the project at thematically appropriate events such as the Car-Free University Day or the Parking Day in Cottbus.

## Measuring under live conditions

In order to collect initial comparative data, but also to pick up interested citizens, we were drawn to the roadside relatively quickly. Using our own bicycles and cargo bikes, we generated our own trajectories and were able to compare them with "normal" road traffic. Even here, important patterns emerged that were crucial for the subsequent evaluation routine.

## CitRad makes itself known

At the Parking Day in Cottbus, CitRad (briefly renamed City Radar) met with great interest and approval.

To make CitRad better known to the city's population, we also ventured to various city festivals. For example, visitors to the Karlstraßenfest were able to experience their own radar signature as a sound output.

At more topic-specific events such as the Car-Free University Day, we were able to exchange ideas with mobility researchers from BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg and exchange initial ideas on where and how CitRad can be particularly effective.

We were also represented with CitRad at Parking Day 2023. This event is dedicated to critically examining the space that cars take up in urban areas through parking alone and how this can be used as an alternative to improve the quality of life in cities. CitRad also met with an interested audience here. Our approach of bringing perceived truths back to facts was consistently perceived as an important first step.
